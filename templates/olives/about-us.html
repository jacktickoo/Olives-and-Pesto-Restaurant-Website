                        <h4 class="mt-5 p-5"> Olives and Pesto is Glasgows’s first fresh italian-mexican eatery, specialising in serving unique and deliciously original regional dishes.</h4>
                        <p class = "p-3 mb-2"> Our seasonal menu also includes weekly specials and a mouth-watering array of cured meats, fish and artisan cheeses. We have handpicked prime wines — both old world and new — to complement our menu, and we’re confident in saying we offer the finest Negroni this side of Florence.</p>

                        <p class = "p-3 mb-2"> Olives and Pesto celebrates the Italian and Mexican heritage of cousins Karl and Umar, while also paying tribute to Glasgow, a city of culture, comfort and soul. For the duo, there’s nothing that represents the same more than a fresh taco or a plate of pasta. Bringing different but complementary skills to the dinner table, Karl and Umar are two essential ingredients in the finest homemade recipe. They are a formidable family force in the kitchen and on the floor, and just like their Nonna Bianchi, occasionally at the bar as well.</p>

                        <p class = "p-3"> One of five spirited siblings, Karl was a passionate food lover at the beginning, emanating a satisfied hum during meals amid the noisy din of his brothers and sister. Karl has had a diverse culinary career but, most significantly, he spent four months as a chef at a highly reputable Trattoria in Northern Italy, a place where he learnt to respect the use of fine ingredients by understanding the importance and beauty of simplicity. He arrives at Glasgow fresh from a successful few years of running celebrated family pop-up, Café Mulino in London, and plans to advance his rare savvy for simple but innovative cuisine ever further at Olives and Pesto.</p>

                    <p class="p-3 mb-5"> Umar has been showing people a good time for a long time, her dazzling social prowess matched only by her entrepreneurial spirit. Umar has spent much of her career in Sydney, building an impressive reputation as one of hospitality’s most prized assets. Having managed some of Sydney’s premiere venues, Umar has gained an extensive knowledge on food, wine, cocktails and coffee. However, the family force remained too strong a pull, and nothing has proved more enriching than being home in the UK and embarking upon this exciting new venture with her best friend.</p>
